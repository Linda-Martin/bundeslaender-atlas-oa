Repository to start a community work on mapping the activities of Open Access in Germany

# data file
The data was collected as a part of the BMBF-funded project "open-access-network" and comprises three levels: The activities of the federal states, state dossiers (so-called "Länderdossiers") and the activities of the institutions (approx. 800 institutions), with an initial focus on research institutions under public law. The collection is updated regularly.

  # State dossiers
  
Based on the data collection, state dossiers will provide a compact overview of the status quo of Open Access within a federal state at a specific point in time (2021/2022). In the form of written texts, the dossiers are put together in close consultation with contact persons in the respective ministries and gatherinformation on the historical development and the current situation within a state. In addition to that,the state dossiers contain framework conditions as well as networking measures and examples of goodpractice.
